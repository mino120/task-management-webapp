## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system
- **Board Management:** Create, view, and manage multiple project boards
- **Task Organization:** Create tasks and organize them into customizable lists
- **Kanban-Style Interface:** Track progress by moving tasks between "To-Do", "Doing", and "Done" lists
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** 
  - Scala 2.13.x
  - Play Framework 3.0.7
  - SBT (Scala Build Tool)
  
- **Frontend:** 
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Bootstrap 4.5.2
  - Font Awesome 5.15.3
  - jQuery 3.5.1

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11 or higher
- SBT (Scala Build Tool)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-webapp.git
   cd task-management-webapp
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   sbt run
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:9000
   ```

4. Login with the demo account:
   - Email: demo@example.com
   - Password: password
   
   Or register a new account.

## Authentication System

The application implements a session-based authentication system:

- **Registration:** Users can create new accounts with email and password
- **Login/Logout:** Session management for authenticated users
- **Access Control:** Protected routes require authentication
- **User-Specific Data:** Boards and tasks are associated with specific users

For demo purposes, the app uses in-memory storage. In a production environment, you would:
- Connect to a database
- Implement password hashing
- Add email verification
- Add more security features

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Board

1. Log in to your account
2. Click "New Board" in the navigation menu
3. Enter a name and optional description for your board

### Tracking Progress

1. Move tasks between lists to track their progress
2. Tasks in "To-Do" haven't been started
